My love was written in pen
Yours was in pencil
It all might be erased
But in certain sunlight
I still see the indents
Of your old words.

I trace the faded letters
With trembling fingertips
Remembering the pressure
Of your hand on mine
Before you chose the eraser
Over the indelible line.

Please, come back with your pencil
Write over the ghost marks
Even if you erase again tomorrow
I need to see your letters
Dark and whole, just once more
Before the indents fade completely.
